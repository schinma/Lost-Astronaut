# Lost-Astronaut
Game made with Valentin Gerard and Victor Kern for the final term exam of our 3D Game Basic (Unity) course at Keimyung University<br/>
Only the orange level is finished not the green one.

What I did more specifically on the programmation of this game :

- Character & camera controller â€‹
- UI & Audio Manager
- Life bar and oxygen managment
- End game managment
- Items collection
